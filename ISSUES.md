# Issues

I have managed to match the land size classification with the report but only to some extent.

To be more specific, I have been able to match the Statement 1.3 in the report (page 46-47) with my data.
However, I am unable to match the Table 23A in the report (page A-1018) with my data.

Here is a table that shows the difference in monthly household incomes. Any help is appreciated.

| Land Size Class | HH Income I get | HH Income in report | Difference | Difference % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < 0.01 | 8070 | 11,204 | 3,134 | 28% |
| 0.01 - 0.40 | 7562 | 7,522 | -40 | -1% |
| 0.41 - 1.00 | 8683 | 8,571 | -112 | -1% |
| 1.01 - 2.00 | 11435 | 11,449 | 14 | 0% |
| 2.01 - 4.00 | 16373 | 16,435 | 62 | 0% |
| 4.01 - 10.00 | 28841 | 28,292 | -549 | -2% |
| 10+ | 60886 | 60,758 | -128 | 0% |
| Grand Total | 10218 | 10,218 | 0 | 0% |
